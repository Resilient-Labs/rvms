      <h2>Meet the brothers, inc.</h2>
      <p>At 4280 Washington Street there was a little house that now holds a plumbing business with a long history — TBros. (Trethewey Brothers Inc.) Plumbing, Heating, and Remodeling business. Since 1902, this 4th generation family business has been a mainstay of the Parkway community. With 28 full time employees and a very warm showroom atmosphere, Trethewey Brothers today is operated under the supervision of co-owners Bob Trethewey and Mike Flanagan.</p>
      <p>The Trethewey family’s involvement with RVMS goes back all the way to Roslindale Village Main Street’s beginning.  Trethewey Brothers is one of the founding members of RVMS — alongside other current community business owners like Joe Porteleki from Roslindale Hardware, Greg Laham from Sullivan’s Pharmacy, and Barbara Lottero from the Greater Roslindale Medical and Dental Center. Bob recalls then-Councilor Thomas Menino’s passion for the Square and vision to see it get rejuvenated.  “He just had a way of talking to you that made you feel like everything was going to be OK and that he was looking out for the business community.” Bob reflects fondly on these early years with Mayor Menino building RVMS into the organization it is today.</p>
      <p>The TBros spirit of down-to-earth friendliness is felt as soon as you go in the front door of the business.  Bob discussed how great it is to be centered in Roslindale and to be part of the community. The staff’s collective knowledge and years of experience allows TBros to fix the challenging plumbing and heating problems that occur in older homes.
      </p>
      <p>Bob also commented that homeowners in Rozzie have so many great resources to help them with everything inside or outside the home — locally-owned Wallpaper City, Harrison’s Appliance and Refrigeration and Roslindale Hardware.
      </p>
      <p>We all complement each other in serving Roslindale residents’ home Improvement needs. The service, knowledge, and backup when any problems occur offers peace of mind. “Who needs the Big Box Retailer” when you’ve got all this right in your community!”</p>
      <p>Bob is grateful for the stability that RVMS has had for both the residents and businesses that makes Rozzie the gem it is today. In reflection, Bob is especially proud of his father Ron’s campaign in the 70’s and the development of “We Love Roslindale” image that is a lot like a pre-social media version of our #ROSlove campaign. Bob says that in the early years, bumper stickers and window decals could be found on everything with the red heart next to “We Love Roslindale”.  It seems like some things haven’t changed that much in 40 years. RVMS, and all our business supporters like TBros, are still spreading the community love.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks to the whole team at TBros! We #ROSlove the heck out of you!
