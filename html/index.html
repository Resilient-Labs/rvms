        <h2>we cannot do it</h2>
        <h2>without you</h2>
        <p>For over 30 years, RVMS has counted on donations from residents like you as we work hand-in-hand with businesses, community leaders, and elected officials to revitalize Roslindale Village. What does 30 years of revitalization look like? It looks like a neighborhood that's a destination for dining, both casual and gourmet. It looks like beautiful public spaces for people to gather, from Adams PArk to the Cohasset Street Parklet. It looks like a place to raise a family and start a business. It looks like the Roslindale we built together.</p>
